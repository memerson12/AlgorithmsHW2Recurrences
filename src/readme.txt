Lucas Numbers:
    Part 1:
        What else is Lucas known for?
            One other thing lucas known for is the creation of the Tower of Hanoi game. This game, as demonstrated in class,
            is a game where there are 3 rods and a number of disks. The objective of the game is to move all the disks from one
            rod to another rod without ever placing a larger disk on top of a smaller disk. This game is oft used as a
            teaching tool to teach different algorithms.
    Part 2:
        Do you recognize these numbers?
            The ratio is the same of that of the golden ratio ((1+sqrt(5))/2)
        What is the order of growth of your algorithm?
            the complexity is O(2^n)
        What are the ratios of your successive calculations?
            1.618033988749895
        Your order of growth?
            O(2^n)

Subirachs Magic Square:
    Part 3:
        Count all the 4-element combinations that have the same sum as the rows/columns, etc.
            88
        Count all combinations with this sum.
            310
        Count the number of ways every possible sum can be formed
            See console output
        What sum can be created with the greatest number of combinations, and how many combinations is that?
            66 with 1364 combinations
        Notice anything interesting about that?
            The number is twice that of the desired sum of 33
